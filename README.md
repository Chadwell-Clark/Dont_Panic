# Dont_Panic
In the beginning the Universe was created.
This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. 
Your planet has been scheduled for demolition to make way for an intergalactic freeway.
Welcome to an infinite loop with a calming message. Can you get out in time? 
Your time in the loop is only as long as your lack of resolve. Don't Panic.
Thanks to Douglas Adams
